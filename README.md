# todo
A personal list of things to do.

### Wut?
Happens all the time; I find something interesting or get a recommendation and I forget about it before the end of the day. There are plenty of todo applications I could set up, but why not utilize Github instead?

### Can I... add something?
Sure! If there's something you think would capture my interest please feel free to add it. Anything from interesting tech articles to intriguing shows/series/anime, just add it in as an issue for me to track and I'll get around to it whenever I do.
